# Luna - Cycle-Aware Women's Wellness Platform

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Women's health tracking is fragmented and potentially harmful:
- **89%** of women juggle 4+ separate health apps
- **73%** don't trust unverified social media health advice  
- **93%** of fitness app users focus on weight/appearance over health

## 💡 Solution

WellnessOS is a comprehensive wellness platform that unifies fragmented health tracking through:
- **Cycle-aware nutrition insights** - Understanding how nutritional needs change throughout menstrual phases
- **Pattern recognition** - AI-powered personal health pattern discovery
- **Safety-first design** - Built-in eating disorder prevention protocols
- **Professional oversight** - Future integration with registered dietitians
